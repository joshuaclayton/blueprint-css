h1. GreenScreen CSS Framework Readme

Welcome to GreenScreen! This is a CSS framework forked by "Greenscreen" designed to cut down on your CSS development time.
It gives you a solid foundation and fast to build your own CSS on.

h2. Some Difference by Greenscreen Css
 * Deleted margins, all of columns are adjacent with out margin, if you would margins you must add inner div with margins
 * More modularized with extracting Debuging propertyes and Pull & Push selectors into new files
 * Is no 960, not 950 such as Greenscreen
 * Deleted "borders" selectors...
 * .. and more

We make "GreenScreen" more powerfull and more modularized then Blueprint.

h2. Setup Instructions

Here's how you set up Greenscreen on your site.

# Upload the "Greenscreen" folder in this folder to your server, and place it in whatever folder you'd like. A good choice would be your CSS folder.
# Add the following three lines to every @<head/>@ of your site. Make sure the three @href@ paths are correct (here, BP is in my CSS folder): <pre><code>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/Greenscreen/screen.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/Greenscreen/print.css" type="text/css" media="print">
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/Greenscreen/ie.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
<![endif]--></code></pre>
Remember to include trailing slashes (" />") in these lines if you're using XHTML.
# For development, add the .showgrid class to any container or column to see the underlying grid. Check out the @plugins@ directory for more advanced functionality.

h2. Files in Greenscreen

The framework has a few files you should check out. Every file in the @src@ directory contains lots of (hopefully) clarifying comments.

Compressed files (these go in the HTML):

* @Greenscreen/screen.css@
* @Greenscreen/print.css@
* @Greenscreen/ie.css@

Source files:
* @Greenscreen/src/reset.css@<br/>
This file resets CSS values that browsers tend to set for you.
* @Greenscreen/src/grid.css@<br/>
This file sets up the grid (it's true). It has a lot of classes you apply to @<div/>@ elements to set up any sort of column-based grid.
* @Greenscreen/lib/Greenscreen/grid.css.erb@<br/>
This file is used by the compressor (see below) when generating grids. All changes to grid.css are mirrored in this file, manually. 
* @Greenscreen/src/typography.css@<br/>
This file sets some default typography. It also has a few methods for some really fancy stuff to do with your text.
* @Greenscreen/src/forms.css@<br/>
Includes some minimal styling of forms.
* @Greenscreen/src/print.css@<br/>
This file sets some default print rules, so that printed versions of your site looks better than they usually would. It should be included on every page.
* @Greenscreen/src/ie.css@<br/>
Includes every hack for our beloved IE6 and 7.

Other:
* @Greenscreen/plugins/@<br/>
Contains additional functionality in the form of simple plugins for Greenscreen. See individual readme files in the directory of each plugin for further instructions.
* @tests/@<br/>
Contains html files which tests most aspects of Greenscreen. Open @tests/index.html@ for further instructions.
