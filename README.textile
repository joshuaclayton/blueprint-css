h1. BlueScreen CSS Framework Readme

Welcome to BlueScreen! This is a CSS framework forked by "Blueprint" designed to cut down on your CSS development time. It gives you a solid foundation to build your own CSS on. Here are some of the features BP provides out-of-the-box:

* An easily customizable grid
* Sensible default typography
* A typographic baseline
* Perfected browser CSS reset
* A stylesheet for printing
* Powerful scripts for customization
* Absolutely no bloat!

h2. Setup Instructions

Here's how you set up Blueprint on your site.

# Upload the "blueprint" folder in this folder to your server, and place it in whatever folder you'd like. A good choice would be your CSS folder.
# Add the following three lines to every @<head/>@ of your site. Make sure the three @href@ paths are correct (here, BP is in my CSS folder): <pre><code>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/screen.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/print.css" type="text/css" media="print">
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/blueprint/ie.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection">
<![endif]--></code></pre>
Remember to include trailing slashes (" />") in these lines if you're using XHTML.
# For development, add the .showgrid class to any container or column to see the underlying grid. Check out the @plugins@ directory for more advanced functionality.

h2. Files in Blueprint

The framework has a few files you should check out. Every file in the @src@ directory contains lots of (hopefully) clarifying comments.

Compressed files (these go in the HTML):

* @blueprint/screen.css@
* @blueprint/print.css@
* @blueprint/ie.css@

Source files:
* @blueprint/src/reset.css@<br/>
This file resets CSS values that browsers tend to set for you.
* @blueprint/src/grid.css@<br/>
This file sets up the grid (it's true). It has a lot of classes you apply to @<div/>@ elements to set up any sort of column-based grid.
* @blueprint/lib/blueprint/grid.css.erb@<br/>
This file is used by the compressor (see below) when generating grids. All changes to grid.css are mirrored in this file, manually. 
* @blueprint/src/typography.css@<br/>
This file sets some default typography. It also has a few methods for some really fancy stuff to do with your text.
* @blueprint/src/forms.css@<br/>
Includes some minimal styling of forms.
* @blueprint/src/print.css@<br/>
This file sets some default print rules, so that printed versions of your site looks better than they usually would. It should be included on every page.
* @blueprint/src/ie.css@<br/>
Includes every hack for our beloved IE6 and 7.

Other:
* @blueprint/plugins/@<br/>
Contains additional functionality in the form of simple plugins for Blueprint. See individual readme files in the directory of each plugin for further instructions.
* @tests/@<br/>
Contains html files which tests most aspects of Blueprint. Open @tests/index.html@ for further instructions.
